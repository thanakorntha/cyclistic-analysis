</p>

Welcome to my fictional Cyclistic bike-share data analysis case study! This analysis is a capstone part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera. 

## Background

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Business Task

This analysis aims to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data from January 2022 to December 2022 in order to identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Then, it also aims to extract insights and develop the most appropriate marketing strategies that appeal to casual riders and encourage them to subscribe to annual memberships. 

## Methodology

This analysis follows the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**. 

## Tools

This analysis utilize ***R programming*** to gather all the information, process it, explore the data, and use it to find bike usage's patterns and insights.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is Cyclistic's historical trip data from January 2022 to December 2022. The data is collected by the City of Chicago (a government agency) and published by Cyclistic. The data is publicly available on [this website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

Another option is to run the following code to download the data in 2022:

``` bash
cd ./cyclistic-analysis/data
./cyclistic-bulk-download.bat
```
